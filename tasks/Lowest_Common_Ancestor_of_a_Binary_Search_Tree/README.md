[Link.](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/description/)

**Describtion**:

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

**Complexity of solution**:

Memory: *O*(1)

Time: *O*(*log(n)*)
