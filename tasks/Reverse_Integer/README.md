# Reverse Integer
[Link.](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/description/)

**Describtion**:

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.
Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

**Complexity of solution**:

Memory: *O*(*n*) where *n* is memory that we need to store reversed input variable;

Time: *O*(*log(n)*) with base 10 logarithm.
